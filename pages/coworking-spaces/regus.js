      So, this space and upstart aren't really options for me, but this does have the tenable benefit of being in the heart of downtown knoxville. It is also open 24/7. So, technically there is no free parking, and you have to pay $115/month for parking the First Tennessee building (on top of the $289 month-to-month price as of 5/24/18), but most garages stop charging after 6 and stop reading your ticket after 8, so, really if you stay past 8, you can get free parking.

      As far as the actual spaces go, there's a lot of room for improvement. First of all the spaces have 3-4 desks per room. Only one of the spaces actually <em>had</em> a window, and the other ones looked like something from a chinese sweat shop. That's not why I go to a coworking space. I go for the atmosphere, and the atmosphere has definitely been left wanting. The two ladies at the front when I was there were on their first day and first week. I don't know what kind of employee turnover they have, but that didn't bode well to me. If you want to book a tour through their website you have to give all your personal information, so I showed up unannounced, but I was definitely unimpressed. If you want to have a coworking space, have a big open room. Everyone gets a window, because no one is enclosed in a room. It's just a big open space. And people can see and talk to each other and you create a community. This place is seriously deficient, although it's only a year old, and Knoxville doesn't have many options, so I'm am very grateful that they actually tried at least.

      Also, this is a nationwide collective, so you can go to different coworking spaces where they have locations, not just in Knoxville. It's actually a pretty cool model. I hope they improve their execution.

      Oh, also, they make you pay $30/month for coffee?? I'm not sure if you can bring your own k cups though...I would imagine so, but who knows, sometimes idiots are in charge and make stupid unenforceable rules. Takes all kinds I guess.
