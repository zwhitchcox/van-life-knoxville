      This is definitely the best option in my book. Price is $125/month, $50/month if you're not using it full time, which pretty much no one does. It's in the heart of North Knoxville, directly across the street from Crafty Bastard Brewery and near Remedy Coffee. It's just a great location. It also has open seating and plenty of natural light. A real "hacker" vibe too. The space doesn't take itself too seriously. It is a non-profit that tries to raise technology awareness, and profits go to that. Super nice guy who runs the place. He's letting me test it for a week before I even pay anything. Also, it's run by a non profit and has a really relaxed feel.
