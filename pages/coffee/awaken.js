      So, this could sound picky or whatever, but I guess at Awaken the atmosphere just isn't that great, because the barista space is too big. They take up almost half the space just with that, and it leaves the room feeling closed, and kind of spreads out the tables so you don't really have a sense of community. Also, the space between the door and the barista table is way too big. It just doesn't feel very inviting. Also, parking is kind of a hassle, as with anywhere Downtown or in the Old City. The really great thing about this place though is that they're open till 9, while almost everywhere else closes at 6. That's probably the main reason I go here. Also, getting into the bathroom is a pain, and you're gonna have to touch the bathroom key with bathroom germs all over it. The coffee is decent though, and the baristas are friendly. Also, the chairs are uncomfortable that are at the tables, and the comfy chairs obviously don't have a table top to work on. Honestly, how hard is it to get chairs with cushions? Maybe they don't want you staying there long and try to make you uncomfortable? That seems like a bad business decision. Hopefully that's not it. Have they never sat down before and just don't understand? Idk. Anyway, a good late night cofee shop. Also, it's kind of dark.
